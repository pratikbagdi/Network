Practical 6
Aim – To write a program to implement AES algorithm.

Theory –
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric block cipher adopted by the U.S. government as a standard for encrypting sensitive but unclassified information. 
It's considered to be highly secure due to its complexity and the absence of any known practical attacks against it.

AES Algorithm Overview
AES operates on 128-bit blocks of data, and uses a 128-, 192-, or 256-bit key. The encryption process involves a series of rounds, each consisting of four transformations:
    1.	SubBytes: Replaces each byte in the block with a new byte from a substitution table.
    2.	ShiftRows: Cyclically shifts each row of the block by a certain number of positions.
    3.	MixColumns: Performs a matrix multiplication on each column of the block.
    4.	AddRoundKey: XORs the block with a round key derived from the main key.
The number of rounds depends on the key length: 10 rounds for 128-bit keys, 12 rounds for 192-bit keys, and 14 rounds for 256-bit keys.   

Key Expansion
Before the encryption process begins, the main key is expanded into a series of round keys. This is done using a key schedule algorithm that involves a combination of rotations, substitutions, and XOR operations.

Implementation Considerations
When implementing AES, several factors need to be considered:
    •	Key Length: Choose the appropriate key length based on the security requirements of your application.
    •	Mode of Operation: AES is a block cipher, so it needs to be used in a mode of operation like Electronic Codebook (ECB), Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), Counter (CTR), etc.
    •	Padding: If the plaintext length is not a multiple of the block size, padding is required. Common padding schemes include PKCS#7 and Zero Padding.
    •	Performance: The efficiency of the implementation depends on various factors, such as the programming language, the optimization techniques used, and the hardware capabilities of the system.

Conclusion –
Hence, we have successfully implemented AES algorithm.
